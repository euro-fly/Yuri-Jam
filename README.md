# Yuri-Jam
2016 yuri jam project- "A Cat With No Tail", produced w/ chamotea on twitter

This is the source code to a game I'm working on presently.
Since it's a quick and dirty game jam thing anyway, I figure no harm no foul in posting it.
There'll be a build up and running soon-ish, but for now, you can play the work-in-progress by cloning the repo to your Ren'py projects directory.

Script, Music, Art- @chamotea
Programming, UI, SFX - @hacaplus
